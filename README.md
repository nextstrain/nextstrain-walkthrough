# nextstrain-walkthrough

## Prerequisites

Set up an environment using one of the following options:

### 1. GitHub Codespaces

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/nextstrain/nextstrain-walkthrough)

This launches a preconfigured environment in your web browser or Visual Studio Code.

> [!NOTE]
> A GitHub account is required. There is a [monthly free quota](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts) which varies by account plan.
> This tutorial is expected to use less than 4 core hours and 1 GB.
> Storage use against quota is negligible if the codespace is deleted after you complete the tutorial.

### 2. Binder

[![Open with Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nextstrain/nextstrain-walkthrough/HEAD)

This launches a preconfigured environment in your web browser.
Use this if you prefer not to use GitHub Codespaces or install things locally.

> [!NOTE]
> There are some [restrictions](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/user-guidelines.html#resources-available).
> Notably, sessions are shut down after 10 minutes of inactivity.

### 3. Local installation

> [Install Nextstrain](https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/install.html) +
> [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

Use this if you prefer to install software locally on your computer.

> [!WARNING]
> For live workshops, this is not recommend since it takes time to set up and environments may vary across computers.
> You may need to use `nextstrain shell` to run some commands in this tutorial.
> If you face any issues during the workshop, please use one of the other options.
